# Print numbers from 1 to 100 inclusively following these instructions:
# if a number is multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of this number,
# if a number is multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of this number,
# for numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz",
# print the rest of the numbers unchanged.


for num in range(101):
  if num % 3 == 0 and num % 5 == 0:
    print("FizzBuzz")
  elif num % 3 == 0:
    print("Fizz")
  elif num % 5 == 0:
